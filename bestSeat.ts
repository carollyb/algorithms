/* You walk into a theatre you're about to see a show in. The usher within
the theatre walks you to your row and mentions you're allowed to sit
anywhere within the given row. Naturally you'd like to sit in the seat
that gives you the most space. You also would prefer this space to be
evenly distributed on either side of you (e.g. if there are three empty
seats in a row, you would prefer to sit in the middle of those three seats).
Given the theatre row represented as an integer array, return the seat
index of where you should sit. Ones represent occupied seats and zeroes
represent empty seats.
You may assume that someone is always sitting in the first and last seat
of the row. Whenever there are two equally good seats, you should sit in
the seat with the lower index. If there is no seat to sit in, return -1.
The given array will always have a length of at least one and contain
only ones and zeroes. */
